===============

**Introduction**
---------------

This repository provides a comprehensive collection of machine learning models, divided into two main categories: Classification and Regression. The goal of this project is to provide a easy-to-use and well-structured implementation of various machine learning algorithms, making it easier for beginners and experienced practitioners to get started with machine learning.

**Classification**
-----------------

The Classification folder contains 7 different models, each implemented in a separate section:

1. **Logistic Regression**: A basic linear model for binary classification problems.
2. **K Nearest Neighbors**: A simple algorithm for classification based on nearest neighbors.
3. **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: A powerful algorithm for classification and regression problems.
4. **Kernel SVM**: An extension of SVM, using kernel tricks to improve performance.
5. **Naive Bayes**: A family of probabilistic models for classification problems.
6. **Decision Tree Classifier**: A simple, yet effective algorithm for classification.
7. **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble algorithm, combining multiple decision trees for improved performance.

**Regression**
----------------

The Regression folder contains 6 different models, each implemented in a separate section:

1. **Simple Linear Regression**: A basic linear model for regression problems.
2. **Decision Tree Regression**: A simple algorithm for regression problems.
3. **Random Forest Regression**: An ensemble algorithm, combining multiple decision trees for improved performance.
4. **Multiple Linear Regression**: A linear model for regression problems with multiple features.
5. **Polynomial Regression**: A non-linear model for regression problems.
6. **SVM Regression**: A powerful algorithm for regression problems.
